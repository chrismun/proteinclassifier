# Transmembrane Protein Localization Classification
Localization classification of transmembrane proteins using the OPM dataset with various architectures. 
In each directory is a training script, and the model, however all dependencies may not be there. The architectures are 
not my own, but rather applied to a new task here. For dependencies, see the corresponding project github.

Primary focus on gearnet
