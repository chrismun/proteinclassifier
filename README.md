# Transmembrane Protein Localization Classification
Localization classification of transmembrane proteins using the OPM dataset with various architectures. 
In each directory is the main script to run, and the model, however all dependencies may not be there. The architectures are 
not my own, but rather applied to a new task here. For dependencies, see the corresponding project github, or contact me.
