# Protein Classification AI

This repository contains the code and resources for research on biophysics protein classification using artificial intelligence.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying proteins based on their biophysical properties. We aim to leverage the power of deep learning algorithms and state-of-the-art techniques to enhance protein classification accuracy and efficiency.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the datasets used for training, validation, and testing.
- `models/`: Here, you will find the trained models and any related files.
- `scripts/`: This directory holds the Python scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `utils/`: This directory includes utility functions and helper scripts used throughout the project.
